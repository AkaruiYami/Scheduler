# Greetings!

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

As you can see, this project was started 2 years ago and only recently I decided to make it open to the public.

# How to Contribute?

Well, you can either open a new issue if you want to add or change something.

Or if you found an already opened issue that not yet assigned to anyone and you want to try tackle it, just let me know.

Of course due the nature of this project simplicity, I strongly engourage new seedlings (or begginers) to try it for themselve.

# "I want to contribute but don't know what to give"

Well... you can give simple fixes such as fixing my grammar / spelling erros. (yes, English is not my first language :) ) or adding some documentations, etc.. 

Oh yeah, if you want to make big changes like adding new features and such... be sure to always `open an issue` first to let me know what you about to do.

# Should you create a new branch?

Yes, I encourage it. 
1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone it to your local machine (or you can just edit through github if you wanted to).
3. Create a new branch
4. When you finish, push it into you forked repo (well you can skip this if you really did edit it from github directly, you madman)
5. Create a pull request ( recommended to merge into `dev` instead of `main` )

# Finally

Thank you so so much for taking your time to read this notes. Your time is precious and I want you to know that, I do appreciate it. Please be kind and I wish you, for your success.
